# Borrowing $OD

The first time you connect your wallet to the Open Dollar app you’ll be prompted to create a Vault Facilitator. Signing this transaction will allow you to create new vaults.

Click “Create a Vault” and select your collateral type and amount to deposit.

Once you’ve created a vault, the amount of $OD you can borrow depends on the Minimum Collateral Ratio (MCR) of your deposited assets.

For collateral types like ARB, MAGIC, rETH, and cETH, a collateral ratio of 150% is mandated, while for wstETH, the required collateral ratio is set at 135%. This ensures that the minted $OD is sufficiently backed by collateral, maintaining the protocol's stability and security.

Input the desired amount of $OD to borrow and click “approve” to approve your deposit. Then, click “Review Transaction” to confirm and complete.
