Surplus auctions sell $OD that has accrued inside the protocol in exchange for $ODG. The $ODG that is received by an auction is burned.

How do I bid?

During a surplus auction, you will bid an increasing amount of $ODG for a fixed amount of $OD. A practical example: if the current ODG bid is 100 for 20K OD (resulting in a price of 200 $OD/$ODG), the next bidder must bid more $ODG for the same amount of OD. The auction also makes sure that each bid must be at least a certain percentage higher than the previous one (e.g., the next bid must be at least 3% higher).

What does the Claim Tokens button do?

In case someone outbids you in a surplus auction, your $ODG bid will be reimbursed to your Open Dollar Account. The “Claim Tokens” button can be used to retrieve $ODG (and $OD) that is kept in your Account.
