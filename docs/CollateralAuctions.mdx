![](</img/Collateral Auction Image.png>)\
Collateral auctions are meant to sell collateral that was seized from a vault in exchange for $OD. The $OD that is received by an auction is burned.

**Increasing Discount**

In order to incentivize bidding, collaterals are sold at a discount in comparison with the market price. The discount increases with time, until the discount deadline timestamp, where discount will reach a maximum value.

**Settlement**

Collateral auctions don't have a deadline, they will remain open until either all collateral was sold, or all required $OD was raised, in which case the auction will be closed and the remaining collateral will be returned to the Vault owner.
