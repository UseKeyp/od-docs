Debt auctions mint and auction new $ODG in exchange for $OD. The $OD that is received by an auction will be used to eliminate bad (uncovered) debt from the system.

How do I bid?

During a debt auction, you will bid a fixed amount of $OD for a decreasing amount of $ODG. A practical example: if the current $ODG bid is 100 for 20,000 $OD (resulting in a price of 200 $OD/$ODG), the next bid must accept less $ODG for the same amount of OD. The auction also makes sure that each bid must be at least a certain percentage smaller than the previous one (e.g., the next bid must be at least 3% smaller).

What does the Claim Tokens button do?

In case someone outbids you in a debt auction, your OD bid will be reimbursed to your Open Dollar Account.Claim Tokens can be used to get back OD (and ODG) that is kept in your Account.
