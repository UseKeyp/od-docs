# Introduction to Open Dollar

Borrow against Liquid Staking Tokens & Arbitrum native assets with our flexible and transparently over-collateralized stablecoin.

## Ungovernance
A guiding principle of Open Dollar is decentralization and risk minimization through Ungovernance. As much as possible, the protocol is governed by math and market rates: users always control their collateral, the protocol's redemption rate is always set by the algorithm, and other stuff.
