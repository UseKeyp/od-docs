Fees on the Open Dollar platform are transparent and predictable with no inconvenient changes or surprises.

Collected OD from fees revenue partly funds the ODG-governed DAO treasury and is also used to buy and burn ODG tokens.

**Stability fee**

Borrowing OD is subject to a stability fee that varies by collateral type. For LSTs, this is 2% APR or less, see [Supported Collaterals](https://docs.opendollar.com/Supported-Collaterals) to learn more.

**Liquidation Penalty**

In the event of vault liquidation, vaults are subject to a liquidation penalty of up to 20%, depending on the vault type. This is not a fee incurred due to normal platform use, but as a result of a liquidation event.
