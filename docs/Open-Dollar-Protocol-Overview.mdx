# Using Open Dollar

The Open Dollar platform allows you to easily borrow the $OD stablecoin against your LST or other supported Arbitrum-native assets and create leveraged positions at low rates while retaining 100% of the yields of your deposited collateral.

A unique feature of the Open Dollar platform is the implementation of Non-Fungible Vaults (NFVs), which enable the liquidity of deposited collateral in the form of an NFT and allow for the transfer, trade, or sale of a position without repaying the outstanding loan and can be used to avoid liquidations.

Getting started is as easy as connecting your wallet, depositing your collateral, and minting the desired amount of $OD.

How you use your newly minted $OD is up to you. You can use it for transactions, save it, or swap it on any supported platform for other tokens and leverage your newly unlocked capital according to your trading strategy.

To retrieve your deposited collateral, simply repay the outstanding loan in $OD. You can also transfer or sell your NFV on any NFT marketplace if you do not wish to repay the outstanding loan.
