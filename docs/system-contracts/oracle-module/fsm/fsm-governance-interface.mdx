# FSM Governance Interface

## 1. Summary

This governance interface allows token holders to `stop()` FSM-like contracts in case of an oracle attack.

## 2. Contract Variables & Functions <a id="2-contract-details"></a>

**Variables**

* `owner` - the address of the contract's owner. Meant to set `FSM` addresses
* `onlyOwner` - modifier that checks whether the `owner` calls a function
* `authority` - contract authority, able only to stop an `FSM`
* `fsms[collateralType: bytes32]` - mapping of OSM-like contracts

**Modifiers**

* `isAuthorized` - modifier that checks whether msg.sender can call a specific function
* `onlyOwner` - modifiers that ensures only the `owner` can call a specific function

**Functions**

* `canCall` - checks whether an address can call a function
* `setFsm(bytes32: collateralType, address: fsm)` - set the address of an `FSM` for a specific collateral type
* `setOwner(address: owner]` - change the contract's owner
* `setAuthority(address: authority)` - change the contract's authority
* `stop(bytes32: collateralType)` - stop a collateral type's `FSM`

## 3. Walkthrough <a id="2-contract-details"></a>

The `owner` and the `authority` can be changed using `setOwner` and `setAuthority`. The `owner` can `setFsm`s for each collateral type and any authed address \(be it the `owner`, `authority` or another address that was whitelisted in the `authority` contract\) can `stop` any `FSM`.
