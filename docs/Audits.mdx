The core GEB contracts were audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/open-zeppelin/core-contracts). Other helper contracts were audited by [Quantstamp](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/quantstamp/helper-contracts).

Open Dollarâ€™s changes and additions to this base protocol and those concerning NFVs have been audited by [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-10-open-dollar).

Further auditing is planned prior to mainnet launch.
