### Overview

$OD is Open Dollar’s robust and over-collateralized stablecoin backed by LSTs. It’s $1.00 floating peg is maintained by the protocol’s algorithm which adjusts it’s redemption rate by repricing debt, incentivizing vault managers to take actions to restore it’s value.

### Features

* Stable Value: Pegged to $1.00 for consistency and predictability in transactions.
* Over-Collateralization: Backed by an excess in collateral value, enhancing security.
* Algorithmic Price Stability: $OD's uses a dynamic control system called a PID controller (link to PID section), which continuously adjusts the redemption rate to maintain its $1.00 floating peg to the USD.
* Arbitrage Opportunities: When $OD's market price deviates from its $1.00 peg, the system's adjustments create arbitrage opportunities to restore it. This encourages users to buy or sell $OD to realign its market price with the intended peg which benefits individual traders and the overall stability of the token.
* Decentralized Nature: $OD's decentralized framework diminishes reliance on centralized custodians, reducing risks associated with centralized control and enhancing the security and transparency of users' assets.
