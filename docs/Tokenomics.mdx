## Tokenomics

### Platform fees and revenue

50% of the fees from the Open Dollar protocol go directly to the DAO controlled treasury. The other 50% are used to purchase ODG at auction, continually acruing value to the ODG token. Of the ODG purchased, 50% will be allocated to the treasury for use in grants, incentives, and community distributions, while 50% will be burned forever.
