**Overview**

If the value of the collateral in a vault falls below the minimum collateral ratio liquidation can occur. This process protects the protocol from insolvency risks.

During liquidations, a vault's collateral is lost as it is used to pay off the account's debt. The vault owner will no longer be able to retrieve the collateral by repaying debt. A liquidation thus results in a net loss of 18% to 20% of the collateralâ€™s USD value.

**Avoiding Liquidation**

Vault owners can avoid liquidation by repaying some of the outstanding $OD of the loan or by adding more collateral.

In situations where a vault owner does not have the available funds to repay their loan or add more collateral, they can sell their NFV on any NFT marketplace as another method of avoiding liquidation.
