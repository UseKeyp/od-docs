# Open Dollar Governance Simulator

## Key benefits

The Open Dollar Governance Simulator offers a streamlined, secure, and error-reducing method for managing on-chain proposals.

1. Interactive Proposal Submission: Easily submit on-chain proposals through an interactive UI.
2. Proposal Preview: Preview the effects of proposals on the protocol before implementation.
3. Error Reduction: Reduce errors and streamline product upgrades by simulating proposals and verifying their outcomes.

### How the Governance Simulator Works

## Understanding the Governance Simulator

The Governance Simulator front-end application pulls proposals directly from GitHub allowing DAO members to streamline creating, verifying, and simulating proposals in a secure fashion before they are officially submitted on-chain.

### Simulation Features

* Simulate Transactions: Sequentially simulate all transactions and retrieve transaction lists.
* Virtual Test-Net Fork: Create a virtual test-net to simulate the proposal's future impact.

### Engagement and Transparency

Once a proposal is submitted, it can be shared on social media to engage delegates and ensure high participation. The proposal will then display on the DAOâ€™s Governance page.

Once the proposal is verified and satisfactory, it can be submitted to the DAO, provided the user meets the voting requirements for Open Dollar Governance.

## Leveraging the Governance Simulator Open Dollar DAO

### Submitting Proposals via Governance

1. Submit via Open Dollar App: Use the [Open Dollar app](https://gov.opendollar.com/) to submit proposals.
2. Programmatic Submission: Submit proposals programmatically via [GitHub](https://github.com/open-dollar/od-governance-manager/tree/main).
3. Virtual Testnet App: Utilize the virtual testnet for proposal simulation.

## Key Benefits

1. Version Control: All files are checked into Git for version control.
2. Review and Testing: Proposals can be reviewed and tested by others, reducing human error.
3. Deterministic Output: The script generates call data, targets, and values, providing a clear understanding of the proposal's impact.

1. Proposal Creation: New proposals are created using a secure script in GitHub, ensuring a verifiable and secure process.
2. Submission and Simulation: Proposals are submitted to the Governance Simulator application, where delegates can verify proposal details and simulate each transaction. This includes creating a fork of the proposal as if it had passed on Mainnet.
3. Verification Process:
   * Visit the dashboard.
   * Grab the RPC and input it into your wallet.
   * Review the results of the passed proposal to ensure it is adequate.

### How It Works

1. Script Execution: Run yarn propose g -a to pass your proposal script.
2. Proposal Details: Pass the path of your proposal details file.
