title: Proposals and Voting

The Open Dollar DAO can be accessed on [https://gov.opendollar.com/dao](https://gov.opendollar.com/dao).

On this dashboard ODG token holders can create proposals, vote on active proposals, become a delegate, and delegate their ODG to other DAO members to perform governance functions on their behalf.

The Open Dollar DAO on-chain voting and governance platform is powered by Tally.xyz. For more information on how to use the Tally governance interface, see their [docs](https://docs.tally.xyz/).
